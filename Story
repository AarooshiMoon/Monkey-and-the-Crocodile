Once upon a time, there lived a gentle Crocodile and on a nearby tree lived a very smart Monkey.
They were very good friends.
Everyday, the monkey would pluck some juicy apples for the Crocodile.
In the afternoon, the Crocodile would swim to the center of the pond and pick some fishes for the monkey.
One day, the Crocodile told her wife about his friend.
